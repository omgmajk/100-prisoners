# 100-prisoners
Simulation of the 100 prisoners problem.

Inspired by the video ["The Riddle That Seems Impossible Even If You Know The Answer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA), by Veritasium

It seems that if prisoner 0 is successful, there is a high chance of all prisoners being successful. In a few cases it stops on prisoner 1 but I haven't seen it stop beyond that and in that case all prisoners will survive.
